## Description

Digital Scholars Data Science is an introduction to topics that intersect between statistics, computation, and real-world applications. This 5-week-long course will be project-driven, which will give students opportunities to analyze real-world datasets and discover the impact of the data. Students will gain an understanding of complex ideas in statistics and computing, and consider the social impact and issues of Data Science such as privacy and design.

## Class Times

* 9am-1pm CST Monday–Thursday (June 28 – July 30)
    * 9-10am Guest Speaker
    * 10-11am Lecture/Discussion Part I
    * 11am-12pm Lecture/Discussion Part II
    * 12-1pm Lab/Discussion
The schedule might vary for each day depending on the lesson material being covered (i.e. sometimes there may be 2 hours of Lab/Discussion instead). Jonas and Tamun will be here for the 10am-1pm portion to lead the lectures and labs (one of us will be here for the guest speaker portion). We will also take a short break in between hours if needed.

## Course Materials

* **Laptop or Desktop Computer**: Your computer should should run on Windows, OS X, or Linux. Android Tablets, iPads, Chromebooks, and other similar devices are not supported. You will need to be able to install both Python and git to complete the labs (instructions provided).

* **Lecture Binder/Folder**: Since this class is only online, you are encouraged to prepare your notes ahead of class in the way that works best for you (e.g. print notes and keep in Binder/Folder, save files in a designated folder on any device, or another system that works best for you). I recommend keeping all of your notes together in one place to stay organized in this fast-paced course. Taking notes in this class is very important to succeeding and learning about Data Science. All notes and resources will be available on the website before each class if you want to print them out (i.e. before 9am M-R).

## Learning Collaboratively

Data Science is a collaborative science. So do work together, and do not try to do it alone.

Each time we meet, we will spend at least 1 hour working collaboratively in smaller groups. We encourage you to work together and discuss all of your course assignments with your friends and classmates! You will learn more from each other as you talk through the problems, teach each other, and share any ideas you have. 

## Technical Issues

TBD

## Academic Integrity

Collaboration is about working **together**. Collaboration is **not** giving direct answers to a friend or sharing the source code to an assignment. Please do your best to make a serious attempt to work through each assignment and discuss with others your ideas and doubts so everyone can get more out of the discussion. Your answers **must** be in your own words, and your code must be typed (not copied/pasted) by you.

Penalty for academic dishonesty: TBD

Academic integrity includes you protecting your own work. If you share your work directly with others and they submit your works as their own, I will consider this as an academic integrity violation as if you submitted someone else's work as your own.
