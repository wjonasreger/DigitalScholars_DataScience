## Data Science Setup for Windows
Data Science requires a few tools to help us discover interesting features in our data. We will primarily use two tools and several libraries within each of these tools. The two tools are:

* **python**, a simple programming language *(this allows for the computer to do the work for us)*
* **git**, a distributed version control system/repository tool *(this runs technology behind “github”)*

All of these tools are free (and open-source), so it just takes a few minutes for you to install them to get started!

## Installing python
You will need Python 3.6 (or later). We will first check if you have Python already (if you have done Data Science) and install it if you don’t already have it.

### Checking for existing Python
1. Open up your <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources/cli.html">command prompt</a>

2. Type `python --version` and press **Enter**.

* If you see `Python 3.7.1` (or similar), you are all set – no need to install Python. *(Skip to the git section.)*

* If you see `'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`, install it now:

### Installing Python
1. Visit <a href="https://conda.io/miniconda.html" target="_blank">https://conda.io/miniconda.html</a> to get Miniconda, a light-weight version of the python programming language

2. Download and install the latest Windows, **64-bit** installer for the latest version of Python (eg: 3.7).

3. After the install finishes, exit your command prompt, re-launch it, and verify it installed by following the steps above.

## Installing git
Any modern version of git works. We will first check if you have git and install it if you don’t already have it.

### Checking for git
1. Open up your <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources/cli.html">command prompt</a>

2. Type `git --version` and press **Enter**.

* If you see `git version ...` (or similar), you are all set – no need to install git! *(You’re done!)*

* If you see `'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`, install it now:

### Installing git
1. Visit <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a> to get git, a distributed version control system/repository tool

2. Download and install the latest Windows installer.

3. After the install finishes, exit your command prompt, re-launch it, and verify it installed by following the steps above.
