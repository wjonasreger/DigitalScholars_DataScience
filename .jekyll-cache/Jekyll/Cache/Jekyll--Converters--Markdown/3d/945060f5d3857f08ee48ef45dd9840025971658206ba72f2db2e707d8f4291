            You must contact him at least 12 hours before it is due for us to be able to do anything.  Take a screenshot of what you are seeing and describe the problem thoroughly. Remember, there's bound to be computer glitches sometimes so try to start your homework early so you don't miss the assignment due date. Again, if you do miss the due date because of technical issues, it will just count as a dropped homework. </i></p>

    <p>A: <i> Do the <a href="" target="blank">practice exams</a> as REAL exams without
            peeking at your notes or the key. The key is to take the practice exams under real conditions, then
            grade yourself, identify weak areas, and study what you got wrong. Keep doing practice exams until
            you are consistently getting the grade you want on the real exam. Come to office hours to get help!</i></p>

            it uses a partially completed notebook that you fill in during class. There are also weekly Lon Capa assignments
            that are very similar in format to those we do in Stat 100.</i></p>
