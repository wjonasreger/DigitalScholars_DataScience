    <p style="text-align: left;">Is the death penalty and effective deterrence against crime? Is chocolate healthy? What is the cause of breast cancer? All of these questions attempt to assign a cause to an effect. Careful examination of data can help us answer questions like these.
    <br><br>In studies, random samples and random assignment of participants to control and treatment groups helps average out differences when there are enough subjects. What do you do when you don't have very many participants? Blocking first, then randomizing ensures that the differences are averaged out with regard to the variables blocked on. We can use conditionals in pandas to help us do this!

    Data Science is a BIG thing at Illinois and it starts here at Discovering Data Science!
    <br><p style="text-align: left;">Today we introduced ourselves and covered the syllabus information for this class, which can be found on the <a href="https://wjonasreger.github.io/DigitalScholars_DataScience/pages/syllabus.html">syllabus page</a>. We will address additional questions regarding Jupyter Notebooks tomorrow during class.
