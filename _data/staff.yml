    Hi everyone! My name is Karle and I'm one of the stat 100 instructors. I've always loved math, statistics, and education. Teaching stat 100 is the perfect job for me since I can help students from many different majors gain an appreciation for all 3.<br><br> A few other things about me: I'm a huge Illini fan- I went to school at UIUC, met my husband at UIUC, and now I work here. U of I is one of my favorite places in the world! I also enjoy spending time outside, playing piano, water skiing, snow skiing, and traveling.

    My name is Tamun (tah-min) Hanjra and I am a Junior studying Psychology with a concentration in Behavioral Neuroscience and Child Developmental Psychology. I am from Northern VA, about 30 minutes out of D.C. I loved STAT 100 when I took it and was also a CA for STAT 107 after taking it in it's pilot semester, so I decided to try to get involved with being a CA for this class! Some other facts about me: I am in the Marching Illini Drumline and play the cymbals, so hopefully you can catch me on game days when they hopefully happen again. I have a dog back home whose name is Caspar and I will absolutely show you pictures. I also play the flute, love to read and have been obsessed with Tik Tok for a while now! :)
